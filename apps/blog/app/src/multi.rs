//! The multi-server model — a fleet of servers, a crowd of clients, and one batch between them.
//!
//! Every server here is the same real taipei stack the single-server visualiser runs
//! ([`assemble`]): a real [`QueueLayer`](taipei::queue::QueueLayer) fronting a gated
//! leaf app, shedding on its real 100 ms deadline. They share one [`World`], so there is one
//! virtual clock and one discrete-event pump however many machines the picture draws.
//!
//! What the chapter is after is what **client-side routing** costs when the choice is
//! uninformed. Each client picks one server uniformly at random and stays with it — the
//! sticky, no-feedback policy — then sends all of its requests down that one connection at
//! once. Ten balls into ten bins: a third of the fleet is left idle while some server holds
//! three clients' worth of load, and the queue on that server sheds. The latency table is
//! where that shows up. How lopsided that gets is a ratio, which is why the three numbers that
//! set it travel together as a [`Batch`].
//!
//! These are clients the chapter *owns*, so a refusal is not where a request ends: the client
//! picks again — just as blindly — and asks again, and keeps asking until somebody answers.
//! What a shedding fleet costs is therefore a length rather than an absence. It is the whole
//! reason the percentile sim has anything to draw, and it is why a round trip here is a
//! [`Trip`] of several [`Attempt`]s and not one request one server answered.
