//! The cluster — ten real single-server engines, running at once.
//!
//! Where [`MultiEngine`](crate::multi) fires one batch and settles, the cluster is
//! **continuous**: ten independent [`SimEngine`]s, each its own world and clock, all
//! advanced by one frame together. Every server is the same taipei stack the
//! single-server chapters drive, so a box's numbers and that server's full picture are
//! two readings of one running machine — the point this sim makes.
