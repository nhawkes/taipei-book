//! **Percentile** — the same batch read at two percentiles at once.
//!
//! The cluster and the fan-out say what a batch cost overall. This one says who paid: the
//! median client's round trip beside an unlucky one's, cut into the same four phases and drawn
//! against one shared axis, so the gap between a p50 experience and a p90 experience is a
//! length rather than a claim. That gap is the chapter's point — a fleet can look healthy on
//! the mean and be bad for a tenth of the people using it.
//!
//! The batch is the real one ([`MultiEngine`]) and it settles **in the browser**, a frame of
//! virtual time per animation frame, so the two readings grow into place as requests come home.
//! Nothing runs until the reader sends: the card mounts as four phases at rest, and a scale's
//! fleet is not assembled until that scale is asked for. A settled batch is far too dear to be
//! a server's work — a mount gets milliseconds, and a client that keeps asking can spend
//! seconds of virtual time getting an answer.
