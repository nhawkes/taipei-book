//! The blog's **live table** — the sims, and the code-tab set, all **normal DOM lives**.
//!
//! A markdown ` ```sim ` fence becomes a live marker in the page body
//! (`blog_core::markdown_view`); this crate is that live's live half. Each instance
//! reads **its own** resolved spec off its live key ([`SimKey`]) and runs an ordinary
//! message loop shaped like Racket's `big-bang` and Elm's TEA: state in signals,
//! `on-tick` as a frame **message** (`ctx.frames(&running.read(), …)` — the Elm-style
//! signal-gated subscription), `to-draw` as ordinary reactive DOM bindings. No canvas, no escape hatch, no second wasm: the
//! moving parts are positioned elements the existing command stream updates, so a sim
//! is inspectable in devtools and **replayable from its message log** like everything
//! else.

// live **key** ([`SimKey`]), so nothing sim-specific rides the page node.
// A code group is fetched with the page, so the tab island has its data at first paint —
// the marker in the prose carries the group's id, and the island reads it back.
