//! The separate service — the half of rate limiting that is not on the server.
//!
//! [`taipei::rate_limit`] gives a server two things to do with a tenant: bank what it cost,
//! and refuse a share of it. Neither says what the share should be, and neither can: a
//! server sees its own traffic, and a split decided per machine would have each machine
//! reaching a different answer about the same tenant. So this is the other side of that
//! seam — the shared store both servers talk to, and the thing that reads it each second
//! and writes back what to refuse.
//!
//! # The three seconds
//!
//! The chapter's point is the delay, and it is not incidental. Three things happen once a
//! second and each reads what the one before it left *last* second:
//!
//! 1. **write** — the blame the servers accrued goes to the store,
//! 2. **calculate** — the allocator reads the store and divides the budget,
//! 3. **read** — the servers pick up the shares and start refusing by them.
//!
//! So a tenant that starts flooding at `t` is not refused by its new share until `t + 3`.
//! [`Store::epoch`] performs all three in that one order, which is what produces the lag:
//! shifting the last stage first means each stage moves a value the stage behind it wrote
//! an epoch ago.
//!
//! # Why it predicts rather than reacts
//!
//! A loop with three seconds of lag in it will oscillate if it is steered by the last reading
//! alone, and this one oscillates especially hard, because refusing a tenant destroys the
//! evidence it is judged on: refuse it, measure almost nothing, read that as a tenant that has
//! gone away, lift the refusal, and the flood is back. So the middle stage does not divide the
//! budget between what was *measured* — it divides it between what each tenant is predicted
//! to want, from its whole record under [`RECENCY`] decay. One starved second cannot talk it
//! out of what a tenant has been doing all along.
