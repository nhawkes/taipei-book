//! The queue visualiser as a **normal DOM live** — the real taipei stack in the engine,

//! stage, its readouts and the dot swarm — is [`MachineView`], a pure function of the
//! per-tick [`Frame`] this loop folds ([`build_frame`]) and publishes. The running system
//! is inspectable in devtools and replayable from the live's message log like any other

//!
//! Update discipline: the live ticks at 30 Hz (`ctx.every`) and publishes one [`Frame`]
//! snapshot per tick; the controls' readouts are memos over the knobs
//! ([`Computed`](idyll::Computed)s bail on `PartialEq`), so a binding rewrites the DOM
//! only when its own value moves — the change-detection is the framework's, not
//! hand-rolled. What each snapshot means for the picture is [`MachineView`]'s to draw.

    //   eyes. The bare-app sims run slow enough to read the lifecycle; the protection
    //   stages run faster, because by then the parts are known and the broad behaviour
    //   is the point.
    // - **Arrivals.** The bare app opens comfortably underloaded (cpu-only capacity is
    //   ~360/s, mixed ~100/s), so the reader pushes it into overload themselves — the
    //   `try` highlight marks that slider when the prose asks. The protection stages
    //   open already under the load they exist for: the queue absorbing a heavy spike,
    //   the limiter steadily rejecting the overflow while serving within its limit.
    // - **Client patience.** A flat 1 s. A healthy server's honest round trip is well
    //   under that (~0.5 s worst case), so it times nobody out; under overload latency
    //   explodes past any deadline, so the exact value barely matters — 1 s reads as a
    //   plausibly impatient client without dragging the bad-server "gives up" beat.
    // Paced against the network model: an in-region leg is 6 virtual ms, so a frame has
    // to buy little enough virtual time that the short legs still read as travel. The
    // manual sims go slowest — they show ONE request's lifecycle end to end, and a ping
    // is over in ~35 virtual ms, so anything faster is a flash rather than a journey.
    // Every sim opens at the slow viewing speed — the one the motion is tuned around
    // (see [`crate::simview`]'s pursuit floor), and the middle of the speed slider's
