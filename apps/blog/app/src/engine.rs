//! Simulation engine for the queue visualiser — the sim live's model half.
//!
//! The **stack is real `taipei`**: arrivals are fed into an actual
//! [`taipei::queue::QueueService`], pulled by a real `QueueWorker`, shed by its
//! real 100 ms deadline, and gated by a real `CpuBackpressureLayer` or
//! `DynamicConcurrencyLimitLayer` — the subject of the chapter runs verbatim. The
//! surrounding world is modelled: a virtual clock, Poisson arrivals, and a leaf
//! [`App`] service that burns CPU/IO time.
//!
//! The CPU gate reads [`Cores`] as its instrumentation. Taking a core is a worker
//! unparking and dropping one is a worker parking, which is the signal
//! `taipei::tokio` feeds the layer from a multi-threaded runtime — so the layer
//! needs no wasm concession, and a wrong reserve shows up here as a gate that never
//! shuts. Only the OS-CPU signal is modelled, in `App::poll_ready`: sampling the OS
//! is the alternative the chapter compares against, not a taipei layer.
//!
//! Async tasks mutate the shared [`Sim`] state; each frame [`SimEngine::tick`]
//! advances virtual time, pumps the runtime, and snapshots `Sim` into [`Obs`]
//! for the live's DOM fold.
