//! LiveView state for the queue visualiser — **snapshot-derived motion that always travels
//! the pipes**. Each frame the engine hands over `obs.live` (every request and its
//! [`Station`]); this layer moves a dot per request along the drawn topology toward that
//! station. Deterministic legs (the network glides, an IO circuit, the queue's deadline
//! conveyor) are *placed* by the engine's progress and dilate with the sim-speed knob;
//! the un-modelled hops *between* stations (reaching a worker, the core, admission) are
//! *pursued* — at a base rate near the target, faster the further behind
//! ([`CATCH_UP_MS`]) — paced by virtual time within a clamped band so a hop tracks the
//! speed knob without ever crawling (trailing the engine) or blinking.
//!
//! The dot **commits to each leg and walks it to the end before adopting the next
//! station** — arrive-before-you-leave — so every structural waypoint is actually
//! traversed, never cut across. Position may lag the engine's timing; colour (keyed off
//! the station) is the instant truth and the dot catches up.
//!
//! Every dot records the exact polyline it walked this rendered frame — start, every
//! vertex crossed — as its [`Dot::frame_path`]. The paint layer emits it verbatim as
//! the frame's `offset-path`, so even *interpolated* positions lie on the walked
//! route: no corner is ever cut.
//!
//! The two waits at the worker boundary are **separate queues**, as they are in the
//! kernel and in tokio: the SYN pipe holds the kernel accept queue (teal — FIFO, nothing
//! can be inserted ahead of you, so motion is forward-only by construction), and the
//! return-pipe column holds the tokio run queue (amber — spawned handlers and IO wakes,
//! stacking downward and compressing under load). They share only the worker pool.
//!
//! Entrance and exit are the first and last legs of the same walk, and the same *kind* of
//! leg: a request arrives as [`Station::NetworkIn`] (network io, placed down the SYN pipe)
//! and leaves as [`Station::NetworkOut`] (network io, placed out its verdict's pipe — a
//! shed request *into the queue, then back out*). It is live for both, so its dot is an
//! ordinary dot the whole journey and despawns once the reply is off the stage. The one
//! exception is the request nobody is waiting for any more: it has no leg home, so it
//! drops where it stood and fades.
