//! **Rate limiting** — three tenants, two servers, and one budget between them.
//!
//! The blame panel showed a server working out what each tenant cost it. This is what a
//! fleet does with that number. Both servers run the real
//! [`queue_rate_limited`](crate::compose::queue_rate_limited) stack: blame goes out through
//! the tenant reporter into a [`Store`] they share, a separate pass divides the budget by
//! weighted fair share once a virtual second, and the servers refuse traffic by what comes
//! back.
//!
//! What the picture is for is the **delay**. Write, calculate, read — each reads the epoch
//! before it, so a tenant that starts flooding is not refused by its new share for three
//! seconds. The table is laid out as those stages left to right, so the reader watches a
//! number walk across it one column per second rather than being told that it does.
