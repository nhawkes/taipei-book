//! **Flow** — demand that does not stop, and the choice each client makes in it.
//!
//! The spike sims ask what one batch cost. Nothing can be balanced there: every client sends
//! at once, knowing nothing, so the draw *is* the routing. Under continuous demand a client
//! sends again and again and gets answers back between sends, and that is the whole of what a
//! policy has to work with.
//!
//! Both cards run the one fleet ([`MultiEngine::flowing`]) — ten real taipei stacks admitting
//! on CPU backpressure — and differ only in what they let the reader do with it. The first
//! shows that the loop exists: ten machines filling unevenly under one arrival rate. The
//! second puts the three policies on a pill and lets the reader change which one the crowd is
//! using *while it runs*, because what a policy is worth is a comparison and a comparison the
//! reader has to reload for is not one.
//!
//! Switching does not reset: what is already in the air was sent under the old policy and is
//! still owed an answer under it. The fleet the reader is looking at is the fleet they have
//! been loading all along.
