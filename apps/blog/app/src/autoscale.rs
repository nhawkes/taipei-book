//! **Autoscale** — the fleet that buys itself a machine, and the two readings it can buy on.
//!
//! Every other fleet card in the chapter has ten machines and asks what to do with them. This
//! one asks how many there should be. The crowd, the wires and the boxes are the flow card's
//! ([`MultiEngine::flowing`], ten real taipei stacks); what is new is that only some of them
//! are in rotation, and something moves that number while the reader watches.
//!
//! Two scalers run side by side on the same demand, and the pill says which one the reader is
//! looking at. Both are fed the same arrival stream from the same seed, so what separates the
//! two histories is the reading each steers by and nothing else — the whole comparison the
//! section's aside is making. Switching does not restart either: the fleet the reader turns
//! to has been running all along, which is the only way its lag is visible at all.
//!
//! What each reading is, and why one of them is late, is [`crate::scale`].
