//! **Fan-out** — ten clients, ten servers, one sticky-random batch of a hundred
//! requests, and what it costs. The servers are [`ServerBox`] atoms down the right; each
//! client is a dot on the left, coloured by how loaded the server it stuck to is (a
//! client that piled onto a hot server wears the hot colour). The boxplot below is the
//! real latency the batch paid, partitioned into phases — the tail is the imbalance.
//!
//! A wire layer connects each client to the server it stuck to, on the canvas its traffic
//! rides — aligned to the HTML boxes by runtime measurement (`measure=>`): the stage, every
//! client dot, and every server box report their laid-out rects, and the wires are a pure
//! function of those rects, so they re-bow whenever the layout reflows.
