//! **The cluster** — ten real servers, and the two ways to read one. Each server is a
//! [`SimEngine`](crate::engine) from [`Cluster`](crate::cluster), running live from cold at
//! `t=0`. The fleet view draws each as a [`ServerBox`] summary off its own state; drilling
//! into one draws that same engine in full through [`MachineView`](crate::machine_view) — the
//! summary and the picture are two readings of one running machine, which is the sim's lesson.
//!
//! Ten engines tick every frame whatever is on screen, so the fleet you zoom out to is the
//! fleet that was running while you watched one server. Only the focused server keeps the
//! motion state its picture is drawn from; the rest need only their counts.
