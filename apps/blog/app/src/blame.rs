//! **The blame panel** — where a shut gate's cost goes. One [`SimEngine::tenanted`] server with
//! three tenants on it, its [`TenantReporter`](taipei::tenant::TenantReporter) reading the gate
//! from below the queue, drawn twice: the accounting on top, and the machine the accounting is
//! about ([`MachineView`]) underneath, so every microsecond in the strip belongs to a request the
//! reader can watch move.
//!
//! The strip **is** the bill. `World::pump` is a discrete-event stepper, so between two of its
//! events nothing changed: one interval becomes one cell per occupier, and the meter's wind across
//! that interval is what each of them accrued ([`BlameSpan`]). Summing cells is therefore summing
//! the library's own draws — the picture cannot disagree with `attributed()`, because it is not a
//! second calculation of it.
