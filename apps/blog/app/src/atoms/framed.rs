//! Framed — a diagram and the control that steers it, as one box.
//!
//! The control belongs *to* the picture, not to a band above it: a switch that recolours the
//! diagram reads as part of it, and a reader looking at the picture finds it without leaving.
//! So the frame owns the corner well and the placement, and the caller owns both the diagram
//! and the control — neither knows about the other.
//!
//! The frame draws no surface of its own. Whatever is placed inside brings its own (the
//! machine picture is already a card; a table sits on one), so a surface here would be a
//! second border around the first.
