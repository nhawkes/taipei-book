//! Lanes — wire traffic as two-edge pulses.
//!
//! A request on screen is a two-edge pulse. The **front** edge is the request itself and runs
//! on the engine's clock — one network leg long, invisible at ×1 by design. The **back** edge
//! is afterglow: user-facing persistence, [`AFTERGLOW_MS`] of wall clock at every speed, never
//! a position — it only ever trails where the request really was. The head is a hard cut, so
//! the cliff *is* the request; everything behind it is memory.
//!
//! All sends departing one wire, one direction, one colour, in one frame merge into **one
//! pulse**; opacity carries the count. A frame was always the floor of temporal resolution, so
//! requests indistinguishable in time share a pulse rather than pretending to be separable —
//! which is also what bounds the work: pulses scale with wire count × frame rate, never QPS.
//!
//! The **carrier wave** is rate rendered as texture, never requests — each wire's crest
//! frequency is locked to that wire's own smoothed rate and its depth fades out as the wire
//! goes quiet, handing over to individual pulses exactly as they become sparse enough to
//! read. Out and home waves counter-scroll half a wavelength apart; direction survives in hue.
//!
//! Mechanically a tier holds the traffic and nothing else: [`frame`](LaneTier::frame) seats
//! the frame's departures and ages what is already flying, and [`paint`](LaneTier::paint)
//! writes what that comes to as [`Shape`]s along each wire's own bow — where a pulse is on its
//! wire is the curve's parameter, so a bow runs its traffic faster through the shallow middle
//! than through the turns. Nothing here is an element, so nothing here is retained: a card
//! whose loop stops stops drawing, which is why the loop runs on while anything is
//! [`airborne`](LaneTier::airborne).
