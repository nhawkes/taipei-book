//! Slider — a labeled range control with a live value readout.
//!
//! A **controlled** component: the value belongs to whoever is driving the machine, so
//! it arrives as a signal and every move is reported back through a callback. What the
//! slider owns is its own presentation — the filled length of its rail and the text in
//! its readout — derived from that one value, so the fill and the number can never say
//! different things.
