//! Waterfall — one request's round trip, phase by phase, each drawn where it *happened*.
//!
//! The [`LatencyTable`](crate::atoms::latency_table) draws the same cut as a distribution: four
//! boxplots over a whole batch, each starting at zero. This draws one client's experience, and
//! each phase sits at its own offset — so the row reads as a life rather than as four bars
//! sharing a baseline, and the gaps between them are the waiting.
//!
//! Presentational (`Never`): the caller passes the legs in the order the request met them and
//! the axis to scale against. The atom does the running sum, because a cumulative offset is
//! geometry; it does no percentile maths and knows no model types.
