//! The tenants-and-servers stage: a column of tenant dots on the left, server boxes in the
//! middle, and the live wires between them.
//!
//! Where [`wires`](super::wires) is the geometry, this is the picture built out of it — the
//! measured stage, the dots, the boxes, and the three strokes each wire carries: the bare
//! connection under everything, the verdicts on their way home in their own colours, and the
//! requests travelling out in their tenant's.
//!
//! Two sims draw it: the blame panel, where three tenants share one server, and the rate
//! limiting chapter, where the same three talk to a fleet of two. The difference is only how
//! many boxes and therefore how many wires — a tenant on a fleet is several [`Wire`]s sharing
//! a dot, which is why a wire names both of its ends rather than being found by position.
//!
//! The rects come in as signals and the measurements go out as one callback, because
//! measurement is the caller's message loop's: a component that owns no messages cannot
//! receive the layout it caused.
