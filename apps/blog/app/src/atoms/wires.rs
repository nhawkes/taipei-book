//! The clients-to-servers stage: a column of client dots, a column of server boxes, and the wire
//! overlay between them.
//!
//! The overlay is aligned to the HTML boxes by runtime measurement (`measure=>`): the stage,
//! every client dot and every server box report their laid-out rects, and each wire is a pure
//! function of three of them — so the wires re-bow whenever the layout reflows, and nothing has
//! to be told a box moved.
//!
//! Every card that wires a crowd to machines draws from here. What they share is the geometry
//! and the surfaces; what each keeps is what its own wires *mean* — a sticky assignment, a
//! tenant's connections, warm pools, a balancer tier.
//!
//! The crowd cards draw theirs as [`Shape`]s on the canvas their traffic rides ([`standing`]),
//! so a wire and the pulses on it come off the one [`Bow`] into the one display list. The
//! panels that mark positions with dashes instead ([`marks`]) are still SVG paths, drawn from
//! the same bows through [`wires_d`].
