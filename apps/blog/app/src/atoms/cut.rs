//! A percentile reading and the dial that moves it — one column of a comparison.
//!
//! Two cards read a distribution this way: the percentile card cuts one batch at two places,
//! and the policy card cuts three fleets at the same place. What they share is not a layout but
//! a claim — that a reading's *place on the scale* has a colour, and that the dial, its readout
//! and the bars under it all wear it, so a column reads as one subject rather than as a control
//! next to a chart.
//!
//! The colour is published as a custom property by the column and inherited by everything
//! inside it, which is why it cannot drift: there is one declaration, not three arguments that
//! could disagree.
