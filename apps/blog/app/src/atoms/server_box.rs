//! ServerBox — one server as a box of live numbers: busy-core pips, the three queue
//! depths it keeps (kernel accept, taipei admission, runtime), the work in flight, and
//! the running outcome tallies. The shared atom of the multi-server sims — the cluster
//! grid tiles it live off each engine, and the fan-out stacks it down one side.
//!
//! Controlled (`Never`): the counts arrive as a [`Signal`], so a box drawn off a running
//! engine updates its readouts in place as that engine moves, and a box drawn off a fixed
//! snapshot takes a constant. A zero reads in the muted "nothing here" colour so a glance
//! across a fleet finds the loaded boxes; a real count wears its section's hue.
