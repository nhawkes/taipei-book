//! Strips — stacked time-series rows, one reading each, scrolling as the sim runs.
//!
//! The panel a practitioner already reads: lines moving left while the machine runs, so an
//! edited setting shows up as the lines *changing* rather than as a number the reader has to
//! remember to compare. Two cards draw them — the balancer tier's five percentiles of one
//! distribution, sharing one eased ms axis because they are readings of each other, and the
//! autoscaler's demand, fleet and refusals, each on an axis of its own because they are not.
//!
//! Presentational (`Never`): the caller decides what a sample is, what it is worth against,
//! and what the row says it is. What lives here is the geometry the two share — [`slot_x`]
//! and [`y_of`] for a point, [`note`] and [`mark_path`] for the rules under it, and the
//! cadence and depth ([`SAMPLE_MS`], [`POINTS`]) that make a slot mean the same width in
//! both.
