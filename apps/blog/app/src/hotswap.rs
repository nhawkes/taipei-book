//! A tower service whose inner composition is swapped at runtime behind a stable front.
//!
//! The queue visualiser shows the reader a `ServiceBuilder` stack and then runs it. For
//! the shown code to *be* the run code, the sim cannot rebuild its whole machine when a
//! tab, gate, or slider changes — the front every client task holds would change with
//! it. Instead the front is a [`HotSwap`]: built once, wrapping whichever composition is
//! currently loaded. Switching tabs rebuilds only the **inner** stack — the exact
//! `#[shown]` composition function whose source the panel displays — and loads it here.
//!
//! The swap is safe against tower's readiness contract because a clone only adopts the
//! newly-loaded inner at [`poll_ready`](Service::poll_ready) — never between a
//! `poll_ready` and its `call`. A reservation, once granted, is honoured by the same
//! inner that granted it; the next `poll_ready` picks up the swap. A request already in
//! flight completes against the inner it was admitted by.
