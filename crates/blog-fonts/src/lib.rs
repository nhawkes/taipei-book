//! The blog's web faces, bundled.
//!
//! The type scale names three families — IBM Plex Sans (body), IBM Plex Mono (numbers and
//! code), Newsreader (display serif). They used to arrive from the Google Fonts CDN, a runtime
//! fetch to a third party on every first paint. Here the woff2 ride in the binary (`include_bytes!`),
//! so a fresh clone serves its own type with cargo and nothing else — the same self-contained law
//! that brings Binaryen in as a crate rather than a machine install.
//!
//! The faces are the OFL-1.1 latin subsets from the `@fontsource` packages (see `fonts/OFL-*.txt`);
//! only the weights the scale actually asks for are carried. [`FACES`] is the single source: the
//! bytes it embeds and the `@font-face` rules [`install`] writes are generated from the same list,
//! so a face is declared once.
